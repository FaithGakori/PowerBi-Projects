## 1. Call Center
   
   Call centers continue to play a vital role in today's digital landscape by providing crucial customer support, fostering customer loyalty and upholding the organization's       brand reputation.
   This project is focused on evaluating agent performance and gauging customer satisfaction.
   By analyzing these insights, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of overall         call center performance, the effectiveness of individual agents, and customer              sentiment. This will enable us to improve the quality of service provided to our customers and     invest in targeted training for our call center team. Explore the             dashboard for more insights!
